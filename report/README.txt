------------------------------------------------

Thank you for using this template! Read through this file to get started and optimize your template usage.

This template was created initially by Kerr Beeldens. I, Rahul Raoniar, modified this template to fit the requirements of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. 

Let me walk through it.

This template consists of three folders and one main.txt file

---------------------
1. `Chapters`

The `Chapters` folder consists of

1.1 Frontpage: where all the relevant details of the front page exist. It includes logos, images, and a table stating the student's name and enrollment number.

1.2 Introduction: This section consists of all the sections, tables, images, and equations. 

1.3 Appendix: It is attached at the end of the report. 

------------------------
2. `Figures`

The `Figures` folder consists of a `Legos` folder and a `flowchart.txt` file which is inserted inside the report. 

The Logos folder has the IITB logo and front page image.

------------------------
3. General

The General folder consists of the following:

3.1 Preamble: It comprised all library calls and tikz (library) geometry definitions for the flowchart.

3.2 References: It includes all BibTeX references.

3.3 Settings: The Settings.tex file includes all the formatting definitions of the report. Formattings like titles, sections, lists, color, table of contents, captions, and fonts.

From the Setting.tex, you can alter front page details or even customize every aspect of the lab report.


------------------------
4. main:

The main file calls all the .tex files from `Chapters`, `Figures`, and `General` and builds the report pdf.
